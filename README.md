# FYR_Project
Contains SAV files of trained LASSO, Ridge, PLS and SVR models, alongside scaler objects used for pre-processing of data.
Example.py file contains information on how to load models and used for predictions.
Care must be ensure that input files contain only the Mordred Descriptors listed for each subset prior to using the model to predict LFLs.
A full list of feature names for the experimental and mixed subset can be found in "Mixed_Subset_Descriptors.xlsx" and "Experimental_Subset_Decscriptors.xlsx", respectively.
